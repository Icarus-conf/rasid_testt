# rasid_test

A new Flutter project.

## Overview

This Flutter application allows users to fill out a job application form, upload their CV, and handle offline data submission when connectivity is restored. The app integrates Firebase for backend data storage and utilizes the Hive package for local storage.

## Features
- User Registration Form: Allows users to input their name, email, phone number, birthday, job role, experience, and education level.
- CV Upload: Users can upload their CV in various formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX).

- Real-time Connectivity Monitoring: The app detects changes in network connectivity and updates the user interface accordingly.
- Firebase Integration: Submitted data and CVs are stored in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.
